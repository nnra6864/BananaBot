# FAQ
- Q: Can this get me banned?
- A: No, there's no anti cheat involved, and as far as the game is concerned, you are just performing regular clicks.

# Setup

## EXE
Head over to [Releases](https://github.com/nnra6864/BananaBot/releases) and download the latest exe.

2. Install [pynput](https://pypi.org/project/pynput/) by running `pip install pynput` or using your package manager

# Tips
- Virtual Machine
Using a Virtual Machine allows you to continue using your main system while the bot is running.
I would recommend [VMWare](https://www.vmware.com/products/workstation-player/workstation-player-evaluation.html.html.html.html) or [Virt Manager](https://virt-manager.org/) with [QEMU](https://www.qemu.org/).
- Sandbox
Sandbox will allow you to run multiple steam and game instances at once.
This way, you can collect a lot more bananas and utilize the bot to it's full potential.
I highly recommend [Sandboxie](https://sandboxie-plus.com/).
